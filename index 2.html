			<p>Weezer is an American alternative rock band from Los Angeles, California formed in 1992 by Rivers Cuomo, Patrick Wilson, Matt Sharp, and Jason Cropper. Soon before their debut album was released, Jason Cropper was fired from the band, and was replaced with their new rhythym guitarist, Brian Bell.</p>

			<p>From 1998 until 2001, Weezer consisted of Rivers Cuomo, Patrick Wilson, Brian Bell, and their then new bassist, Mikey Welsh. </p>

			<p>From 2001 onwards, after the Green Album tour was completed, their lineup now consists of Rivers Cuomo, Patrick Wilson, Brian Bell, and Scott Shriner.</p>

			<p>Weezer is a band that inspires extreme loyalty. By releasing two of the most revered rock records of the '90s — their 1994 debut “Weezer” (aka the “Blue Album”), and 1996's cult hit “Pinkerton” — the group amassed a fanbase that feverishly connected with its nostalgic lyrics, singalong choruses and guitar riffs.</p>

			<p>
			The specificity of the verses complimented by the universality of the chorus makes for a great antithesis of the polished pop songs perfected on The Blue Album, inspiring a generation of artists in the new millennium. As Cuomo once stated, “I don't really know what emo means.</p>

			<p>The genre of Weezer can be different in multiple albums. <strong>Blue</strong> is more on Geek Rock and Alternative, while <strong>Pinkerton</strong> is on an emo side and nearly being grunge. </p>

			<p>Starting from <strong>Green</strong> onwards, they go to a less personal style of singing after the initial failure of Pinkerton. This can be seen with Green, but the Pinkerton style songs came back in <strong>Make Believe.</strong>

			<p>But from <strong>Raditude</strong> to <strong>Hurley</strong>, they were focused on pop, but didn't execute it quite well, which resulted in mixed to negative reviews.<center></p>

In addition, "Beverly Hills" also earned Weezer their first Grammy nomination for Best Rock Song. Despite this, Make Believe received mixed reviews from critics and fans, although it has remained a consistent seller. </td>

        <td>Van Weezer is the fifteenth studio album by American rock band Weezer, released on May 7, 2021, by Crush Music and Atlantic Records. Featuring a classic rock and hard rock inspired sound, the album was announced in September 2019 with an original release date of May 2020, coinciding with announcement of the band's participation in the Hella Mega Tour alongside Green Day and Fall Out Boy. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the tour was delayed indefinitely and Van Weezer's release was delayed until May 2021, almost four months after the release of the band's previous album OK Human.</td>
